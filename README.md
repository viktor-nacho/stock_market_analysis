## üöÄ How to Use (Quick Start)

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub details!)*
2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas pdfplumber matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Prepare your PDF files:**
    * Create a folder named `stock_files` in the root directory of the project.
    * Place your daily stock PDF files inside this `stock_files/` folder.
    * **Important:** Ensure your PDF filenames follow a consistent pattern for date extraction (e.g., `DAILY_PRICE_LIST_May_20_2024.pdf`). The script expects the date format `%B_%d_%Y` (e.g., "May_20_2024") after removing "DAILY_PRICE_LIST" and ".pdf".
4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook stock_analysis_v5.ipynb
    ```
    Open the `stock_analysis_v5.ipynb` file in your browser and run all the cells. The script will process your PDFs, perform the analysis, generate plots, and save the results (`stock_history.csv` and `output.csv`).
